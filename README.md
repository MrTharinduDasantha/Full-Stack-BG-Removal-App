# Full Stack BG Removal Website

In this project, I will make a BG Removal app using React JS, Node JS, Express JS, Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB.

This app first allow users to upload an image. Then will process the image and remove the background using AI and then user can download the image with a transparent background.

In this full stack bg removal website I have created user authentication with the help of clerk. Clerk allows us to create user authentication and user management with few lines code. It provides beautiful and ready to use UI components like login form, registration form and user profile component that we can easily integrate in our website.

Each user who creates the account initially gets 5 credits. It costs one credit to remove the background of one image. After the credit is over, user can buy credit under three packages. But that part is not yet created in this project.
